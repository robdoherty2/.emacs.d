;; This is my .emacs file. There are many like it but this one is

;; useless. Without my .emacs file I am useless. I must code my .emacs
;; file true. I must code faster than my enemy, who is trying to
;; kill(1) me. I must kill(1) him before he kill(1)s me. I will.
;; Before God I swear this creed: my .emacs file and myself are
;; defenders of my country, we are the masters of my enemy, we are the
;; saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace.
